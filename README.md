# Hello Respected Viewers <img src="https://github.com/AsadAzam/AsadAzam/blob/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px">

This is **Pranjal Kar**, a passionate individual in the field of **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. 
I have recently completed a successful ML Internship, where I gained hands-on experience in implementing various NLP techniques. Additionally, I am currently expanding my knowledge in **Data Structures and Algorithms** and exploring Web Development using **Python-Flask**. I am also proficient in **Database Management Systems** which play a crucial role in various aspects of Computer Science. Moreover, I possess skills in backend technologies using **Python** and frontend technologies using **Vue.js**.

## Insights About Me:

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on real-time sign detection application based on ISL (Indian Sign Language). It utilizes a CNN model and hallmarks from Mediapipe Holistic. To further enhance communication and learning among the deaf community, we have also developed an MVP of an Ed-Tech platform that generates Sign Language videos from normal videos.
- I have done a ML Internship , where I implemented various NLP techniques. I am also learning DSA and Web Development using Python-Flask, I am also proficient in  DBMS that is used wide open in every aspect of CS.I am also skilled at backend technologies using python, and frontend using Vuejs, currently.  
- ðŸŒ± I am actively involved with an NGO aiming to monitor the position and activity of Rhinos in various forests of Assam using Computer Vision and other technologies.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am eager to collaborate on projects related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science.
- ðŸ’¬ Please Feel free to contact me at pranjalkar99.work@gmail.com for any help, queries, or collaboration opportunities.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I am more than happy to assist and collaborate on any projects.

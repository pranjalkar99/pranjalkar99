# Hello Respected Viewers <img src="https://github.com/AsadAzam/AsadAzam/blob/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px">

## Hey, I'm Pranjal Kar!  

A **machine learning enthusiast** who loves tackling real-world problems with **AI** and **data-driven solutions**. I graduated with a **B.Tech in Electronics and Communications** from **Tezpur University** (8.4 CGPA) and leveled up my skills through a **Dual Degree in Data Applications** at **IIT Madras**.  

I've worked on some pretty cool projectsâ€” like at **CDAC, Bangalore**, diving into **AI for network security**, and developing **ML-Ops solutions** at **Ovvy** for **multimodal model APIs**.  

At **Compfox** (a US-based startup), Iâ€™m built **conversational AI chatbots** and **LLM applications** with **Langchain and LlamaIndex**, along with **ML EDA pipelines** for **legal  AI tech**. I also spent time as a **Research Intern at Aaranyak**, where I applied **ML and computer vision** to **wildlife conservation** (Rhinos, specifically!).  

Beyond work, I enjoy building impactful projects like **Yog**, an **AI-powered holistic health app**, and **Shruti-Drishti**, a **real-time ISL-based sign detection app**â€”one of the winners at the **Hasgeek Open Source AI Hackathon**.  

Always down for new collaborations in AI. Feel free to hit me up at **pranjalkar99.work@gmail.com** or connect on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranjal-kar-3b4691196)**.  

Let's build something awesome! ðŸš€

<!-- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working and experimenting on various Machine Learning techologies. 
- I have done a ML Internship , where I implemented various NLP techniques. I am also learning DSA and Web Development using Python-Flask, I am also proficient in  DBMS that is used wide open in every aspect of CS.I am also skilled at backend technologies using python, and frontend using Vuejs, currently. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various project related to Machine Learning, or Deep Learning, as well as Data Science Projects.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently worked on ISL based real time sign detection application that uses a CNN and hallmarks from mediapipe hollistic, along with a LTSM model to predict the signs , for better communication between the signers, and non-signers. We also created a MVP of a Ed-Tech platform that generates content from normal video to Sign Language video for efficient communication and learning among the deaf community, which is around 65 million in India.
- I am also working in a NGO that aims to monitor the position and activity of Rhinos in various forests of Assam, using Computer Vision and other technologies.
- Please feel free to contact me on : pranjalkar99.work@gmail.com for any help/Queries. I will more than happy to help/collaborate in any projects.

# Hello Respected Viewers <img src="https://github.com/AsadAzam/AsadAzam/blob/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px">

This is **Pranjal Kar**, a passionate individual in the field of **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. . Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communications at Tezpur University, I've also been exploring the world of Data Applications through a Dual Degree program at IIT Madras.

With a knack for solving real-world problems using AI and data-driven approaches, I've delved into exciting roles like AI Intern at CDAC, Bangalore, and ML-Ops Developer at Ovvy (Through DAAS), contributing to cutting-edge projects in network security and multimodal model APIs.

In my latest venture with Compfox, a US-based startup, I've been crafting conversational AI chatbots and LLM Applications based on Langchain and LlamaIndex and leveraging ML EDA pipelines for legal applications. As a Research Intern at Aaranyak, an NGO, I developed ML and Computer Vision solutions for wildlife conservation of Rhinos.

Beyond the tech realm, I love working on impactful projects like "Yog," a holistic AI-enabled health app, and "Shruti-Drishti," a real-time ISL based sign detection app aimed at bridging communication gaps.

Always up for collaborative opportunities, I'm open to exploring new horizons in the AI landscape. Connect with me on pranjalkar99.work@gmail.com or connect through Linkedin(https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranjal-kar-3b4691196) 

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I am more than happy to assist and collaborate on any projects.

<!-- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working and experimenting on various Machine Learning techologies. 
- I have done a ML Internship , where I implemented various NLP techniques. I am also learning DSA and Web Development using Python-Flask, I am also proficient in  DBMS that is used wide open in every aspect of CS.I am also skilled at backend technologies using python, and frontend using Vuejs, currently. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various project related to Machine Learning, or Deep Learning, as well as Data Science Projects.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently worked on ISL based real time sign detection application that uses a CNN and hallmarks from mediapipe hollistic, along with a LTSM model to predict the signs , for better communication between the signers, and non-signers. We also created a MVP of a Ed-Tech platform that generates content from normal video to Sign Language video for efficient communication and learning among the deaf community, which is around 65 million in India.
- I am also working in a NGO that aims to monitor the position and activity of Rhinos in various forests of Assam, using Computer Vision and other technologies.
- Please feel free to contact me on : pranjalkar99.work@gmail.com for any help/Queries. I will more than happy to help/collaborate in any projects.
